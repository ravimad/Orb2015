### fixed
- [x] fix instumentation of match in dispatch function
- [x] fix problems in nonlinearity
- [x] check that lambdas do not escape for soundness of analyzing data structures
- [x] get initial results for lazy benchmarks
- [x] minimizations of the inference and counterexamples
- [x] Nonlinear bound of Knapsack
- [x] Actual solution of lcs
- [x] Try out trees in RAML

### immediate 
- [ ] BottomUpMergeSort
- [ ] get initial results for dp programs
- [ ] try out minimization for programs
- [ ] make allocations first class, like time
- [ ] Viterbi algorithm
- [ ] report on related works
- [ ] Log bound for Divide and conquer MergeSort
- [ ] Cases like (j >= 0 && lookup(j)) not being handled correctly 
- [ ] freeze benchmarks and code
- [ ] final results and related work 

### supports results
- [ ] DAG inlining (in general Leon context)

### if time permits
- [ ] more benchmarks? iterative DP, lazy pairing heaps, implicit queues, amortized bounds, cyk ?
- [ ] Support @traceInduct for proving timebounds. For this we need to handle templates in body.

### done, needs fixing
- [ ] allow compositional verification

### work in source, future 
- [ ] support @finite annotation
- [ ] Support type instances in closure conversion
- [ ] Consider the application of synthesizing thresholds
