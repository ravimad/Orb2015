Statically inferred formula: 4*l.size + 0

Reducing coeff 0 starting from 0
Lowest possible value for the coefficient is 0
Pareto optimal template: 4*l.size + 0
First counter-example for 4*l.size + -1 is at the point 0

Reducing coeff 1 starting from 4
Lowest possible value for the coefficient is 3
Pareto optimal template: 3*l.size + 0
First counter-example for 2*l.size + 0 is at the point 10
