Statically inferred formula: 16*n*n + 4

Reducing coeff 0 starting from 4
Lowest possible value for the coefficient is -52
Pareto optimal template: 16*n*n + -52
First counter-example for 16*n*n + -53 is at the point 2

Reducing coeff 1 starting from 16
Lowest possible value for the coefficient is 6
Pareto optimal template: 6*n*n + 4
First counter-example for 5*n*n + 4 is at the point 7
