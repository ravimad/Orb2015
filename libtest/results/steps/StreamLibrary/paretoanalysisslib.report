Statically inferred formula: 25*l.size + 6

Reducing coeff 0 starting from 6
Lowest possible value for the coefficient is 6
Pareto optimal template: 25*l.size + 6
First counter-example for 25*l.size + 5 is at the point 0

Reducing coeff 1 starting from 25
Lowest possible value for the coefficient is 17
Pareto optimal template: 17*l.size + 6
First counter-example for 16*l.size + 6 is at the point 10
